THE SPACE
Imagine coming home to this absolutely beautiful home nestled on the second floor of a corner semi on one of the best streets in the Upper Beach. Tranquility only begins to describe how you’ll feel walking up to your neighbourly open front porch and new home. Come inside to walk up into your private one-bedroom oasis complete with a fully renovated 3-piece executive style bathroom and lovely open concept kitchen and living room adorning gleaming hardwood, high ceilings and a complimenting large bay window.
Your new home is clean, bright and cheerful! The kitchen is fully equipped with beautiful stainless-steel appliances including dishwasher, microwave/fan, stove and fridge. And of course, we haven’t forgotten about laundry – yours is right here in your suite neatly tucked away.
Summer heat get you down this year? Not here! Central air conditioning will keep you cool! And should you prefer to join the heat, there is that lovely front porch and front/side yard to enjoy it. Feel free to BBQ in the yard or simply sip a cool drink and enjoy the hood!
Speaking of the hood, your neighbourhood is one of the most sought after in Toronto. Mere minutes’ walk to the beach, you are close to everything the area has to offer. Amazing shops and restaurants along queen street, Indian Bazaar along Gerrard Street, the beach (1.6km), beautiful parks and great schools – and all within a 12 to 15-minute drive to the downtown Toronto core! Not to mention that TTC is literally steps from your door. To name a few, Woodbine bus is 300 meters, Queen street car and/or bus is 1.2km, Danforth Subway is 1.4km and Danforth Go Station is only 2.1km.

This is a 1 bedroom plus large den attached to a private deck. Den can be used as a 2nd bedroom but the only access to the deck is through that den.

Pet friendly, large apartment above future Jimmy's Coffee (now under construction), where Dundas West meets Roncesvalles.

Rent includes all utilities (heat, hydro and water). Tenant pays internet separately.

Bedroom info:
Master bedroom is huge at 8.3 ft x 18 ft,
2nd bedroom is 10.6 ft x 12.9 ft, This room is attached to the walkout with private deck so if it's used as a 2nd bedroom. the personwho uses the master bedroom would need to walk through this room to use the deck. This may be a deal break for roommate scenarios.

TTC at your doorstep. No laundry in the unit but full service laundromat a couple doors over in neighbouring building. No a/c but you can hook up your own portable unit. Shortcut to Loblaws grocery plaza conveniently located behind the apartment. Steps to UP Airport Express Train.

I'm a polite, tidy, conscientious, third-year U of T Scarborough HBA Psychology Undergrad Mature student who after 6-mths of post-testicular cancer recovery is searching for a closer location to return to school. I'm seeking a respectful, quiet, private living space. (I'm also open to alternative private-spaces such as semi-finished basements etc. but *not* shared rooms.)

My Budget:
- ~$800 monthly (Perhaps a bit more for a quality unit)

My Desired Move Date:
- Flexible (September 1st or October 1st onwards) as I am currently in a respectful month-to-month arrangement with a commendable landlord & am seeking a quality unit with a similar tenant-landlord relationship.

My Desires:
- *Scarborough* area specifically for better access to school (Guildwood Pkwy. to Ellesmere Rd// McCowan Rd to Manse Rd// Also may be open to others *nearby* within reason)
- No apartment buildings/ condos/ shared units/ shared single-bedrooms (aka roommates)
- Private washroom
- Private bedroom/ living space
- Private entrance preferred
- Hydro & utilities included
- Kitchenette preferred but also open to shared kitchen space
- Year-long residence
- Wi-Fi & cable/ satellite access would be nice but not necessary

About Me:
- Single, no dependents
- Full-time student ('Letter of Confirmation' on-hand) for both Fall &Winter semesters (Tuition paid by scholarship)
- Income: 2 consistent cash positions (lab equipment assistant U of T St. George & may assume sanitation position at UTSC as well)// Self-employed vintage video game sales online)
- Has over 4 years in-advance of rent in savings to guarantee rental payment (bank statements on-hand)
- Always pays on time
- Offering 1st, 2nd & last upfront as incentive
- Has solid landlord reference
- Has criminal background check
- Non-smoking/ drugs
- No pets
- Clean &organized
- Quiet & respectful

This is a quiet building on a dead end street, right on the lake, surrounded by parks and green space. South Beach is a great place for social distancing… you have lots of friendly neighbours, but it’s easy to stay at a distance from them. There are no common areas, no place for crowds to gather; no lobby; no elevators. Your unit door opens to the great outdoors! And best of all, you have a huge, private terrace with a hookup for a gas BBQ!

Just outside the building there are parks everywhere, and the lake on two sides. This is a very dog friendly, and bicycle friendly, quiet neighbourhood. Not to mention, you are literally steps from the lake—see photos.
The unit was recently renovated; the bathroom is all new and includes a modern deep bathtub; it also has a large storage closet. The living room and bedroom floors are bamboo; there’s no carpeting anywhere in the unit. There’s a full size washer and dryer in a closet beside the kitchen; another hall closet, and of course a closet in the bedroom. (A real bedroom must have three things: a door, a window, and a closet.) All windows include California shutters.

Utilities (gas and hydro) extra, typically $80/month. This unit does not come with parking, but spots are usually available for rent.

The unit is currently occupied, so showings require 24 hours notice. Private, by appointment only. Please message me to arrange a time to come see it!",craigslist

Nice landlords looking for a great tenant!
$1400.00/month (utilities and internet included).
Polished concrete floors, glass mosaic tiled shower, architect renovated, clean, dry and cozy basement apartment for rent in a vintage home on a quiet tree-lined residential street. Across from Fred Hamilton Park and steps away from the Metro and Little Italy restaurants and cafés. Plenty of light considering it is a basement.

Roughly 600 sq ft, private entrance, the main living space and kitchen sits between the two rooms. Perfect for a couple or professional with bedroom at one end and an office at the other (the one bedroom does NOT have a closet so makes a better office; also our kitchen is above it and it is far too noisy in our kitchen to have someone sleeping below). Shared laundry included. Heavy sleepers preferred as we do have children above – they will be going to school during the day, but make kid noise when they are around.

Pictures show current state - kitchen is being renovated in October prior to the new tenant moving in.

Available Nov 1st – will be showing immediately.

OR you can park in visitors up to 10 nights per month for free!

Move into this suite with brand new top quality eco hardwood laminate floors, installed in 2019 that are not in the photographs yet. This sprawling 1,025 square foot corner suite features soaring windows on two sides, 1 bedroom, 1 bath, easy breezy kitchen, open concept Great Room, ensuite laundry. Most impressive of all - a 1000 square foot bonus outdoor living space - a stunning terrace landscaped with cherry trees, lilacs, peonies, boxwood, and tulips! This terrace is totally private for your exclusive enjoyment. The bedroom features a plush, supportive CALIFORNIA KING size mattress and plenty of storage space. Ideally suited for an executive rental or couple that loves upscale living.

The prestigious Ramsden building is across the intersection from the leafy green Rosedale TCC Subway stop - literally a 3 min walk. The building is mid-rise, with a limited number of suites per floor, so not a high-density building with high traffic and noise pollution. For a building in the heart of midtown, it is surprisingly serene. There is a precious residential integrity to this place that is hard to find anywhere else. The Ramsden is 90% owner-occupied, so there is not that transient feeling of living in a skyscraper.

Former tenants rave about the joys of a sprawling PRIVATE green space, and a bedroom that feels like a REAL, proper bedroom, not a poor excuse for a den or what passes for a bedroom in new build, cookie-cutter condos in the GTA.

Finding a rental unit at this building is rare! A very different feel to the “pack them in like sardines” vibe of the majority of GTA condos. A peaceful residential community, perfect for commuters who need quick access to the Yonge subway line.

Top-notch WALK SCORE to nearby amenities and attractions - stroll to the global flagship Four Seasons Toronto, Royal Ontario Museum, the Mink Mile of haute shops like Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier in under 15 minutes. Looking for a mindful, respectful tenant to enjoy the lifestyle here. Perfect for Yorkville, Rosedale, Terroni and Summerhill LCBO enthusiasts - it's time to pop the bubbly on this terrace overlooking Rosedale!

You will have exclusive, private, ""whole house"" use of the condo, with no shared rooms or bath. There is a shared building rooftop terrace to gather with neighbors and additional building amenities include a FITNESS GYM, party room, and 24-Hour Security.

We are looking for an individual, couple, or group to TAKE OVER OUR LEASE as we are moving closer to work and our family. We are prioritizing individuals who can accommodate a flexible move-in date.
This is quite a unique rental property, as you will be renting the entire house.

This rental unit is pretty amazing. There are four stories in total including the unfinished basement. On the first floor is the main entrance right off Jones Ave, includes a nice curbside which includes a small fence. The mainfloor includes a front hall, well lit living room, and very functional kitchen featuring a double sink, dishwasher, microwave, oven and stove, and AC window unit (included in the unit).

The second floor includes a large linen closet, bathroom with tub, and the bedroom master bedroom. The third floor is a finished attic with great lighting. We presently use this long room as a two person office, but it was previously used as a bedroom. It has slightly less auditory privacy than the main bedroom as it does not have a door, but it is up a winding staircase so it has complete visual privacy.

The house also has an unfinished basement which features storage, a small handy work desk area, and a washer and dryer.

Parking available on the road with a permit from the city, literally right in front of the front door.

**please note that we purchased a portable AC unit for the second floor bedroom and a window AC unit for the attic which has only been used since July 2020. These units will be available for sale to whoever takes this unit and trust us
Great spot for dog lovers as there is a great off leash dog park within a short walk.

No access to backyard as there are other tenants living in a small addition in the rear of the house. They have a separate entrance.
Danforth, Gerrard, and Queen street are only a short walk away for shopping, cafes, bars, and restaurants. Downlands or Pape subway station are a ten minute walk North, and the streetcar on Queen is due south. The beach is also a simple bike ride due south.

The location could not be more ideal.

I am looking for a roommate to live in my luxury condo at Islington and Bloor.

I have a two bedroom condo, but I am out of the country, so you will have the place to yourself the majority if not all of the time.

This is an insanely good deal, as this is essentially like getting your own 1 bedroom condo in Toronto which would cost you at least $2300-$2500 :)

You would be renting my second bedroom. This is a two bedroom, two bathroom condo, so you would also get your own bathroom with bathtub and shower.

Included:
Hardwood Floors Throughout
Dishwasher
Washer and Dryer in the Unit
Stainless Steel Appliances
Second Bedroom and Own Bathroom
Floor to Ceiling Windows in Your Bedroom
Huge Closet
Balcony
Living Room and Kitchen are Furnished
Views
Gym
Party Room
Rooftop Terrace (amazing for the summer)
Concierge
Steps to the Subway
Super clean and quiet

I am looking for someone who is quiet and not looking to party. This has been my home for 12+ years, so you will need to be someone who is responsible. Sorry, no pets or smokers allowed due to allergies.

PLEASE tell me a little bit about yourself and PLEASE include your social media.

If the ad is up, this is still available!

Hello,

Thank you very much for taking your time to email me. l want you to know that the property you are writing me about is still available for move in but before we proceed any further l want you to know that the kind of tenant l am looking forward to have,clean,quiet,respectful and responsible someone that will treat the house with care and respect. l don’t need the partying type but if you can assure me of the safety of the house if i decided to accept you as my new tenant l will be happy to let you rent from me for as long as you wish.I want you to know am on the missionary assignment here with me and my family to United State .
The house is located in a safe and secured neighborhood which i think it is the most important thing for one to know before relocating. You are free to drive or walk by so you can tour the exterior of the building if you wish. Me and my wife decided to handle the rental process ourselves due to our past experience with estate agents and tenant because all they care about is their own commission instead of taking time to verify applicants application and do a proper background check, the last tenant that rented from us through an estate agent destroyed most of our valuable home appliances. I know how much me and my wife spent to replace the things that was destroyed in the house,a whole lot of people have contacted me regarding the house but not just sure of who to accept due to the horrible experience we had with the last tenant so i am really taking my time to look for a very responsible person
that we can trust in as a tenant, all i want is a very responsible person that will take care of the house like his/her own and if you can assure me of the house will be in good hands, i will be happy to let you rent from me for as long as you wish.

Fill the rental application form below and send it back to me as soon as you can if you are really interested in renting the house.
