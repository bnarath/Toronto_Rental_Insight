ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I am moving out of the city for the winter, so I’m looking for someone to sublet my apartment for 8 months! You will live with my roommate, AJ, who is an outgoing and friendly writer and filmmaker. The apartment is super spacious and stylishly furnished (thanks AJ) and occupies the top 2 floors of a detached house on a quiet residential street just off of Bloor and Dundas. The main floor features a spacious living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom and two home offices. There is a dishwasher in the kitchen, and it leads out to a sunny deck with a BBQ and an amazing view of trees that makes you feel like you’re living in the country. AJ works from home in one of the offices. The other office is very large with two desks and will be yours for the 8 months! There is also free laundry in the basement of the house, a storage shed for bikes and other stuff, and a yard with a garden plot that is shared with the downstairs neighbours who are a lovely couple. The landlord is also great and super responsive to any issues that come up.
The house is 5 minute walk from Dundas West subway station (Bloor line + King and Dundas and College streetcars), as well as the UP Express, GO train, College streetcar, High Park, Revue cinema, LCBO, and many shops, restaurants, and gyms along Roncesvalles. You will be living with AJ so he will also be involved with selecting the subtenant. We’re both allergic to most pets (sadly) so no pets. Move in date is October 1, 2020 and move-out date is June 1, 2021. Ideally my bedroom comes furnished (endy queen mattress, very comfortable) but can come unfurnished.",Kijiji
